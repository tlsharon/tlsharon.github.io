## Hi! I'm Sharon
I'm a researcher in linguistics and education with a background in Cantonese (and) acoustic phonetics and language teaching.

Currently working as a senior research assistant at the University of Hong Kong, I study the development and assessment of holistic competencies in higher education by day, and linguistic phenomena by night.

I love my mother tongue, Cantonese, and am working towards helping document and preserve it through research and other projects and collaborations. Exciting things are coming this way - so stay tuned for updates!
